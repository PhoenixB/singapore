<h2><a name="release">Release notes</a></h2>

<p>Lots of extra features, lots of bug fixes and, almost certainly, lots of 
juicy new bugs. Notably: web based admin now pretty much works, GD 2 and
ImageMagick may be used for better thumbnail generation.</p>

<h2><a name="install">Installation</a></h2>

<p><strong>singapore</strong> should work 'out of the box' but there are many 
things that can be done to customize it to your needs. Here are some:</p>

<p>Things you MUST do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extract all the files in the archive, conserving the directory hierarchy, 
  to a directory accessible by your web server.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things you SHOULD do:</p>
<ul class="things">
  <li>Add some galleries and images into the <code>galleries/</code> directory 
  (and remove the example ones provided). <a href="#managing">More info</a>.</li>

  <li>Set file permissions. This part is dependent on your operating system and 
  web server setup and can seem quite daunting to a beginner. Your best bet, if 
  you need help, is to contact your server administrator. Here is the list of 
  files and directories that need to be writable by the web server:
  <ul>
    <li><code>cache/</code></li>
    <li><code>galleries/</code> and all subdirectories and files</li>
    <li><code>includes/adminusers.csv</code></li>
    <li><code>logs/</code> unless logging is disabled</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Log into the admin section and change the password. The username is 
  <code>admin</code> and the default password is <code>password</code>.<br />
  <span class="note">NOTE: a future release will allow multiple admin users with 
  different passwords.</span></li>
  
  <li>If your PHP installation uses GD version 2 or later or you have access to 
  <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a> then you can get much 
  nicer generated thumbnails by changing the option in 
  <code>includes/class_configuration.php</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things you MIGHT do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Edit <code>includes/header.php</code> and <code>includes/footer.php</code>
  or use your own custom header and/or footer files by editing the paths in 
  <code>includes/class_configuration.php</code>.</li>

  <li>Change the <em>secret string</em> value in <code>includes/class_configuration.php</code>.
  This is not essential but it makes it harder for someone to fake an admin 
  session thereby gaining unauthorised access to your galleries.</li>
  
  <li>Edit the values in <code>includes/class_configuration.php</code>. The file is commented
  and should be self-explanatory. For most purposes the default values will 
  be fine.</li>
  
  <li>Make custom "themes" using CSS. <a href="Development.html#themeing">More info</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="managing">Managing your galleries</a></h2>

<p>If using the <a href="#iifn">info in file name</a> system then all management can be done 
directly on the files using, for example, an ftp client. To create new galleries
simply create a new subdirectory of <code>galleries/</code>. To add, move or delete 
images in a gallery simply add, move or delete the image files in the 
appropriate directory.</p>

<p>If you use the admin mode to edit your galleries or images it will 
automatically create the relevant metadata files. If these files are deleted  
<strong>singapore</strong> will revert to using <em>info in file name</em>.</p>
 
<p>There is currently no support for bulk image upload via the admin interface. You
are recommended to use FTP to upload your images and then use the admin mode to
add image information and for occasional additions and deletions.</p>

<h2><a name="iifn">Info in file name</a></h2>

<p>If <strong>singapore</strong> doesn't find a metadata file in a gallery it will try to 
extract some sensible information from the image file and directory names as 
follows:</p>

<p>Underscores (_) are converted to spaces and the file extension is discarded 
by removing all characters after the last . (dot) in the filename. If a filename or 
directory name contains the sequence '<code>_-_</code>' (underscore hyphen underscore) 
or '<code> - </code>' (space hyphen space) then the name will be split on this
separator. The first half will be interpreted as the artist name and the second 
half will be interpreted as the gallery or image name depending on context. If
a separator is not found then the file or directory name is interpreted as the
image or gallery name, respectively.</p>

<p>For example <code>Holiday_Snaps/Tamlyn_Rhodes_-_Pretty_picture_of_Sunset.jpg</code>
will be translated into an image called "Pretty picture of Sunset" by "Tamlyn 
Rhodes" in a gallery called "Holiday Snaps".</p>
