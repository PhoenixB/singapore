<h2><a name="csvformat">CSV database format</a></h2>

<p>If you choose to use metadata files then each gallery must 
contain a CSV (comma separated values) file called metadata.csv
containing the information about images in the gallery and the gallery itself. 
CSV files can be edited manually (in a text editor such as Notepad) 
or using a spreadsheet application (such as MS Excel). Care must be taken when using 
Excel to save using commas as the separator character and not tabs or semi-colons.</p>

<p>The first line of each file stores human-readable descriptions of the fields 
and is ignored by <strong>singapore</strong>. The second line stores information
