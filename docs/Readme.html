<p>You are kindly requested to display a link such as the following on all 
pages generated by singapore:</p>

<p class="boxed">Powered by <a href="http://singapore.sourceforge.net/">singapore v0.9.10PRE</a></p>


<h2><a name="release">Release notes</a></h2>

<p>New features galore in this belated pre-release. Re-index metadata feature to
import images uploaded by ftp. Multiuser system with permissions. User selectable 
language and template (off by default). New admin template and many more. If you 
are upgrading please <a href="#upgrade">proceed as normal</a> then run 
tools/convertdb.php to upgrade the database. Remember this is a preview release 
and is for testing purposes only. You are strongly advised not to run it in a 
production environment. Please report any bugs or strange behaviour on the 
forums or by email.</p>


<h2><a name="install">Installation</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li>Extract all the files in the archive, conserving the directory hierarchy, 
  to a directory accessible by your web server. </li>

  <li>Run <code>test.php</code> to see if your server is capable of running 
  singapore.</li>
  
  <li>Set file permissions. The directories that need to be made writable are:
  <ul>
    <li><code>data/</code> and all subdirectories and files</li>
    <li><code>galleries/</code> and all subdirectories and files</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="#permissions">Help with file permissions</a>.
  </li>

  <li>Run <code>setup.php</code> to create the necessary directories.</li>
  
  <li>Delete <code>setup.php</code> to prevent any unauthorised users from 
  <a href="#uninstall">uninstalling</a> singapore.</li>
  
  <li>Delete <code>tools/convertdb.php</code> whether or not you are upgrading 
  as it would allow unauthorised users to mildly corrupt your database.</li>

  <li>Log into the admin section and change the password. The username is 
  <code>admin</code> and the default password is <code>password</code>.</li>
  
  <li>Add some galleries and images into the <code>galleries/</code> directory 
  <a href="#managing">More info</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Optional but recommended:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a browse through <code>singapore.ini</code> and look at the 
  available options. Each option has comments explaining its function. For most 
  purposes the default values will be fine but you may be able to tweak them 
  to your benefit. See also <a href="#override">overriding default 
  settings</a>.</li>
  
  <li>If your PHP installation uses GD version 2 or later or you have access to 
  <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a> then you can get much 
  nicer generated thumbnails by changing the <code>thumbnail_software</code>
  option in <code>singapore.ini</code>.</li>
  
  <li>Make your own header image (<code>templates/default/images/header.gif</code>)
  with the name of your site.<br />
  -or-<br />
  Edit the default style sheet (<code>templates/default/main.css</code>)  
  to integrate it with your site.<br />
  -or-<br />
  Create your own template be editing the default one. There is currently no 
  documentation on this topic but anyone with a basic grasp of PHP should be 
  able to work it out.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="upgrade">Upgrading</a></h2>

<p>Always back-up first!</p>

<p>Upgrading is usually just a matter of unzipping the new version over the old. 
Your galleries, images, metadata, logs and cache will not be affected but the 
admin password will be reset and the root ini file (singapore.ini) will be 
overwritten. Unless otherwise stated you can keep your old adminusers.csv file. 
When new configuration options are added you will need to either add these 
to your old singapore.ini or re-edit the new singapore.ini in order to keep your 
personal settings. You may want to use a file difference utility such as
<a href="http://winmerge.sourceforge.net">WinMerge</a> to merge the differences.</p>

<p>The default templates will also be overwritten in an upgrade. For this reason 
it is advisable to start a new template (in a separate directory) when making 
customisations.</p>


<h2><a name="uninstall">Uninstallation</a></h2>

<p>Server generated content may be owned by the web server and it may therefore 
not be possible to delete these files via ftp. You can use the setdown function 
provided to remove the cache and logs. Use the admin interface to remove server 
generated galleries and images. Please run this script before removing any other 
files.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../setup.php?setdown">Setdown</a> - CAUTION: this will delete all 
  your logs and cached thumbnails.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="managing">Managing your galleries</a></h2>

<p>If using the <a href="#iifn">info in file name</a> system then all management can be done 
directly on the files using, for example, an ftp client. To create new galleries
simply create a new subdirectory of <code>galleries/</code>. To add, move or delete 
images in a gallery simply add, move or delete the image files in the 
appropriate directory.</p>

<p>If you use the admin mode to edit your galleries or images it will 
automatically create the relevant metadata files. If these files are deleted  
singapore will revert to using <em>info in file name</em>. The username is 
<code>admin</code> and the default password is <code>password</code>.</p>

<p>Galleries may contain <em>either</em> images or further subgalleries. This 
means that if you create one or more subgalleries in a gallery that already 
contains images, these images will be 'hidden'. Removing these subgalleries will
make the images visible again. Galleries containing only images are called albums.</p>


<h3>Bulk image uploading</h3>

<p class="note">NOTE: this feature is experimental. It works on some servers but 
does not on others (including the sf.net servers) and I don't know why. It may 
or may not work for you.</p>

<p>You may upload several images at the same time by first storing them in a 
PKWARE compatible ZIP file. Most archiving utilities are able to produce such 
files also sometimes referred to as <em>compressed folders</em> on Windows. You 
need an unzipping utility on your server to use this feature. Most Linux/Unix 
machines come with the free <em>unzip</em> utility by Info-Zip preinstalled but 
precompiled binaries for nearly all operating systems ever conceived can be 
found on the <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/">Info-Zip website</a>. A Win32 
version is also available here: 
<a href="http://singapore.sourceforge.net/binaries/singapore-unzip-Win32.zip">http://singapore.sourceforge.net/binaries/singapore-unzip-Win32.zip</a>.
Simply place the executable in your PATH or in the singapore root directory.</p>

<p>Upload the archive using the 'new image' option in the singapore admin and 
select 'Upload multiple files'</p>

<p>If the archive contains only images, these will be added to the current 
gallery just as if they had been uploaded individually. If an archive contains 
subdirectories, these will be copied into the current gallery. Any images in 
the archive root directory will be imported as above. This mechanism 
may be used to upload complete directory structures including metadata.csv 
and gallery.ini files. If the archive root directory contains no images and a 
single directory, singapore will navigate into this directory and proceed to 
import the contents into the current gallery as though they were in the root 
directory.</p>

<p>NOTE: There is a maximum size of file that PHP will allow you to upload.
This defaults to 2MB and cannot be changed by singapore. Consult the PHP manual
or you server's administrator for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="iifn">Info in file name</a></h2>

<p>If singapore doesn't find a metadata file in a gallery it will try to 
extract some sensible information from the image file and directory names as 
follows:</p>

<p>Underscores (_) are converted to spaces and the file extension is discarded 
by removing all characters after the last . (dot) in the filename. If a filename or 
directory name contains the sequence '<code>_-_</code>' (underscore hyphen underscore) 
or '<code> - </code>' (space hyphen space) then the name will be split on this
separator. The first half will be interpreted as the artist name and the second 
half will be interpreted as the gallery or image name depending on context. If
a separator is not found then the file or directory name is interpreted as the
image or gallery name, respectively.</p>

<p>For example <code>Holiday_Snaps/Bob_Fenderson_-_Pretty_picture_of_Sunset.jpg</code>
will be translated into an image called "Pretty picture of Sunset" by "Bob 
Fenderson" in a gallery called "Holiday Snaps".</p>


<h2><a name="permissions">Help with file permissions</a></h2>

<p>How to make a file writable is dependent on your operating system and 
web server setup and can seem quite daunting for a beginner. One option that 
will work on nearly all Unix/Linux servers is to chmod the relevant 
files/directories to 777 (consult your FTP software documentation for help on 
using the chmod command). However this option is not considered very secure as 
anyone who has write access the web server (such as the owners of other web 
sites hosted on the same computer) can potentially write to or delete these 
directories. There may be a better way to make your files writable by your 
server but this is something you must take up with your server administrator.</p>


<h2><a name="adminpermissions">The deal with admin permissions</a></h2>

<p>First thing to point out is that singapore admin permissions are not related 
to unix/windows filesystem permissions. If you get a "permission denied" message
from php about a certain file, that's the filesystem permissions discussed in a
<a href="#permissions">separate section</a>. For the purposes of this section an 
'object' is anything that can have admin permissions associated with it; i.e. an 
image or a gallery.</p>

<p>There are two types of users: administrators and users. Administrators can do 
everything and are not bound by permission settings. Only administrators may 
create and edit users and change ownership of objects. Ownership is set at the 
time of creation of the object to the user creating the object. The owner of an 
object may do anything to it except change the owner. Only the owner or an 
administrator may alter the permissions of an object.</p>

<p>There are four kinds of action that may be either allowed or disallowed: 
read, edit, add and delete. Read permissions allow an object to be viewed. Edit 
permissions allow a user to edit (i.e. change) aspects of the object. Add 
permissions allow a user to add sub objects (i.e. images and subgalleries). This 
is obviously meaningless when applied to images but it may be used later to 
allow image comments. Finally Delete permissions allow a user to delete the 
object concerned (and any sub objects).</p>

<p>These four permissions come in two flavours: group and world. World 
permissions apply to all users so if, for example, a gallery has the world add 
permission set then any user can add objects to it. The groups system is 
slightly less intuitive but very powerful. A user may belong to any number of 
groups. These groups are simply alphanumeric names separated by spaces. An 
object may also belong to any number of groups. If a user belongs to at least 
one group to which the object concerned also belongs then the group permissions 
are considered. For example a user has this for their groups field "team23 
photographers friends" and an image belongs to the following groups "friends 
family" and has the group delete permission set then that user may delete the 
object since both belong to the group 'friends'.</p>

<p>Permissions are NOT inherited from parent objects.</p>

<p class="note">NOTE: read permissions are not currently enforced, a future 
version will prevent anyone from seeing objects that do not have sufficient read 
permissions. Note also that there is no mechanism to set image permissions this 
will be ammended in a later release.</p>


<h2><a name="override">Overriding settings</a></h2>

<p>All configuration options may be overridden on a per-gallery and/or 
per-template basis. This means that a particular gallery may use, for example, 
a different template or language to the rest of the site. Also, templates may 
introduce their own configuration settings if they so wish.</p>

<p>Gallery config options are stored in files named <code>gallery.ini</code> in 
the chosen gallery directory. Settings are not inherited by subgalleries; they 
affect only the current gallery and its images.</p>

<p>Template config options are stored in files named <code>template.ini</code> 
in the chosen template directory. Some of these settings are not present in the 
default config file; they are only found in the template config file.</p>

<p>Settings are loaded in this order: default settings (<code>singapore.ini</code>)
&gt; gallery settings (<code>gallery.ini</code>) &gt; template settings 
(<code>template.ini</code>). This may be changed in the future to allow gallery 
settings to override template settings.</p>

<p>Note that there is no restriction on which options may be overridden. 
Overriding some settings may lead to unpredictable operation (e.g. changing 
<code>pathto_galleries</code> in <code>gallery.ini</code>).</p>


<h2><a name="hiding">Hiding galleries</a></h2>

<p>Any gallery (except the root gallery) may be hidden from the listing view
by prefixing the directory name with a dot (<code>.</code>). However it is still
accessible by using its exact URL. For example consider the following directory
structure:</p>

<pre>
galleries/
 |- my_pretty_pictures/
 |  |- trees/
 |  `- flowers/
 |- .a_hidden_gallery/
 |  |- some_embarrassing_pictures/
 |  `- .this_is_also_hidden/
 `- some_other_things/
</pre>

<p>A user browsing the root gallery (e.g. <code>www.example.com/?gallery=.</code>)
will see <code>my_pretty_pictures</code> and <code>some_other_things</code>; 
<code>.a_hidden_gallery</code> and all its contents will be hidden from view. If,
however, the user is supplied with the exact URL (e.g. <code>www.example.com/?gallery=./.a_hidden_gallery</code>)
they will be able to see the contents as usual (in this case only 
<code>some_embarrassing_pictures</code> because <code>.this_is_also_hidden</code>
is hidden as above).</p>

<p>Since a user could guess the exact URL or discover it by some other means, 
this feature is not to be used for concealing sensitive information.</p>

<p>NOTE: see the <a href="#modrewrite">mod_rewrite</a> section for instructions 
on renaming files starting with a . on Windows.</a></p>


<h2><a name="modrewrite">Using Apache mod_rewrite</a></h2>

<p>Firstly you need to ensure that mod_rewrite is available. You must be running
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>, have mod-rewrite installed and 
enabled and furthermore be allowed to override Apache configuration directives 
on a per-directory basis with the use of .htaccess files.</p>

<p>If you don't know the answer to the above then probably the easiest way to 
find out is to try the following instructions.</p>

<p>First copy <code>tools/mod_rewrite.htaccess</code> to the singapore base 
directory and rename it to simply <code>.htaccess</code>. Note: Windows shines
here as a Totally Idiotic Operating System&reg; as it will not let you type 
filenames starting with a . kindly saying "You must type a filename". The only 
way that I know of to get around this totally pointless message is to drop into 
the command line and use <code>ren</code> to rename it. Aaaaaaaarrrrgggghhhh!</p>

<p>Moving swiftly on...</p>

<p>You now need to edit singapore.ini and turn on <code>use_mod_rerwite</code>. 
You also need to specify the <code>base_url</code> option. Set this to the full 
web absolute path to your installation (e.g. the bit after the .com, .org or 
whatever). For example if your gallery is accessed by typing 
www.example.com/singapore/ then the <code>base_url</code> is 
<code>/singapore/</code>.</p>

<p>Lastly you need to edit the .htaccess file. On each of the two lines starting
<code>RewriteRule</code>, about half way along the line there is a 
<code>/singapore/</code>. Change this to whatever you put as the <code>base_url</code> 
above.</p>

<h3>If it doesn't work</h3>

<p>If you get <em>404 File Not Found</em> errors then either mod_rewrite or .htaccess 
files are not enabled. If you get singapore <em>Gallery not found</em> errors 
then there might be a problem with the rewrite rules. If you get unstyled 
singapore pages with no images then then your base_path is probably wrong. If do 
get images but the pages are still unstyled then your template probably needs 
adapting to use the base_url config option. See the default template for an 
example. If you still can't work out what's wrong then just give up.</p>

<h2><a name="including"><code>Include</code>ing singapore into another page</a></h2>

<p>Since v0.9.10 it has been possible to include singapore into your web design
simply by including index.php as in: <code>&lt;?php include("path/to/singapore/index.php"); 
?&gt;</code>. There are, however, a few things that need to be noted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You will almost certainly need to edit your chosen template in order that
  the HTML generated is still valid. For example you do not want two &lt;html&gt; 
  start tags, two &lt;head&gt; sections etc..</li>
  <li>If the file into which you are including singapore is named something 
  other than index.php or it requires additional GET variables (such as page etc.)
  then you will need to change index_file_url to reflect this. For example if 
  the page you are including singapore into is <code>site.php?page=gallery</code>
  you will need to change index_file_url to <code>site.php?page=gallery&amp;amp;</code></li>
  <li>If you want to keep both the included singapore installation and the 
  original simultaneously functional then you can place a file named 
  <code>singapore.local.ini</code> in the same directory as the including file. 
  If found, this file will be loaded after singapore.ini but before gallery.ini 
  and template.ini. It can thus be used to provide local settings such as index_file_url
  mantioned above. Note that base_file and base_url are automatically calculated 
  and should not need to be specified.</li>
  <li>If there is any content on the including page <em>before</em> index.php is
  included then singapore will not be able to send any headers. Possible solutions:
  <ul>
    <li>turn on output buffering before any content is printed and do not flush 
    it until after index.php is included (<a href="http://uk.php.net/manual/en/ref.outcontrol.php">About output control</a>.</li>
    <li>Remove the lines from index.php which try to send header information. 
    Doing this will prevent you from using languages with non-default character 
    sets.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Finally note that currently mod_rewrite doesn't work with such included 
  installations of singapore.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="nomenclature">Naming of parts</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt>Installation</dt>
  <dd>an installation of singapore is contained within a website. It is usually 
  in its own separate directory and contains one gallery: the root gallery.</dd>
  
<dt>Gallery</dt>
  <dd>a gallery is contained within an installation (if it is the root gallery) 
  or another gallery (in which case it is a subgallery and the containing 
  gallery is called the parent). Galleries may contain more galleries and also 
  images.</dd>

<dt>Album</dt>
  <dd>an album is a special case of gallery in that it contains exactly zero
  subgalleries and zero or more images.</dd>

<dt>Image</dt>
  <dd>an image is contained within an album or a gallery.</dd>

<dt>Root gallery</dt>
  <dd>There is only one root gallery and it is not contained within any other 
  galleries. It is located directly in the directory specified by the 
  <code>pathto_galleries</code> option. It is sometimes referred to with a 
  single dot (.).</dd>
  
<dt>Subgallery, Parent gallery</dt>
  <dd>these are relative terms.</dd>
