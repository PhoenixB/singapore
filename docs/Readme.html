<p>You are kindly requested to display a link such as the following on all 
pages generated by singapore:</p>

<p class="boxed">Powered by <a href="http://singapore.sourceforge.net/">singapore v0.9.9</a></p>


<h2><a name="release">Release notes</a></h2>

<p>This first anniversary release implements one of the first and most 
frequently requested feature: bulk image uploading (using ZIP files).</p>


<h2><a name="install">Installation</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li>Extract all the files in the archive, conserving the directory hierarchy, 
  to a directory accessible by your web server. </li>

  <li>Run <code>test.php</code> to see if your server is capable of running 
  singapore.</li>
  
  <li>Set file permissions. The directories that need to be made writable are:
  <ul>
    <li><code>data/</code> and all subdirectories and files</li>
    <li><code>galleries/</code> and all subdirectories and files</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="#permissions">Help with file permissions</a>.
  </li>

  <li>Run <code>setup.php</code> to create the necessary directories.</li>
  
  <li>Delete <code>setup.php</code> to prevent any unauthorised users from 
  <a href="#uninstall">uninstalling</a> singapore.</li>

  <li>Log into the admin section and change the password. The username is 
  <code>admin</code> and the default password is <code>password</code>.</li>
  
  <li>Add some galleries and images into the <code>galleries/</code> directory 
  <a href="#managing">More info</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Optional but recommended:</p>
<ul>
  
  <li>Have a browse through <code>singapore.ini</code> and look at the 
  available options. Each option has comments explaining its function. For most 
  purposes the default values will be fine but you may be able to tweak them 
  to your benefit. See also <a href="#override">overriding default 
  settings</a>.</li>
  
  <li>If your PHP installation uses GD version 2 or later or you have access to 
  <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a> then you can get much 
  nicer generated thumbnails by changing the <code>thumbnail_software</code>
  option in <code>singapore.ini</code>.</li>
  
  <li>Make your own header image (<code>templates/default/images/header.gif</code>)
  with the name of your site.</li>
  
  <li>Edit the default style sheet (<code>templates/default/main.css</code>)  
  to integrate it with your site.</li>
  
  <li>Create your own template be editing the default one. There is currently no 
  documentation on this topic but anyone with a grasp of PHP should be able to 
  work it out.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="upgrade">Upgrading</a></h2>

<p>Always back-up first!</p>

<p>Upgrading is usually just a matter of unzipping the new version over the old. 
Your galleries, images, metadata, logs and cache will not be affected but the 
admin password will be reset and the root ini file (singapore.ini) will be 
overwritten. Unless otherwise stated you can keep your old adminusers.csv file. 
When new configuration options are added you will need to either add these 
to your old singapore.ini or re-edit the new singapore.ini in order to keep your 
personal settings. You may want to use a file difference utility such as
<a href="http://winmerge.sourceforge.net">WinMerge</a> to merge the differences.</p>

<p>The default templates will also be overwritten in an upgrade. For this reason 
it is advisable to start a new template (in a separate directory) when making 
customisations.</p>


<h2><a name="uninstall">Uninstallation</a></h2>

<p>Server generated content will be owned by the web server and it may therefore 
not be possible to delete these files via ftp. You can use the setdown function 
provided to remove the cache and logs. Use the admin interface to remove server 
generated galleries and images. Please run this script before removing any other 
files.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../setup.php?setdown">Setdown</a> - CAUTION: this will delete all 
  your logs and cached thumbnails.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="managing">Managing your galleries</a></h2>

<p>If using the <a href="#iifn">info in file name</a> system then all management can be done 
directly on the files using, for example, an ftp client. To create new galleries
simply create a new subdirectory of <code>galleries/</code>. To add, move or delete 
images in a gallery simply add, move or delete the image files in the 
appropriate directory.</p>

<p>If you use the admin mode to edit your galleries or images it will 
automatically create the relevant metadata files. If these files are deleted  
singapore will revert to using <em>info in file name</em>.</p>

<p>Galleries may contain <em>either</em> images or further subgalleries. This 
means that if you create one or more subgalleries in a gallery that already 
contains images, these images will be 'hidden'. Removing these subgalleries will
make the images visible again. Galleries containing only images are called albums.</p>

<h3>Bulk image uploading</h3>

<p>You may upload several images at the same time by first storing them in a 
PKWARE compatible ZIP file. Most archiving utilities are able to produce such 
files also sometimes referred to as <em>compressed folders</em> on Windows. You 
need an unzipping utility to use this feature. Most Linux/Unix machines come 
with the free <em>unzip</em> utility by Info-Zip preinstalled but precompiled 
binaries for nearly all operating systems ever conceived can be found on the 
<a href="http://www.info-zip.org/">Info-Zip website</a>. A Win32 version is 
also available here: 
<a href="http://singapore.sourceforge.net/binaries/singapore-unzip-Win32.zip">http://singapore.sourceforge.net/binaries/singapore-unzip-Win32.zip</a>.
Simply place the executable in your PATH or in the singapore root directory.</p>

<p>Upload the archive using the 'new image' option in the singapore admin and 
select 'Upload multiple files'</p>

<p>If the archive contains only images, these will be added to the current 
gallery just as if they had been uploaded individually. If an archive contains 
subdirectories, these will be copied into the current gallery. Any images in 
the archive root directory will be imported as above. This mechanism 
may be used to upload complete directory structures including metadata.csv 
and gallery.ini files. If the archive root directory contains no images and a 
single directory, singapore will navigate into this directory and proceed to 
import the contents into the current gallery as though they were in the root 
directory.</p>

<p>NOTE: There is a maximum size of file that PHP will allow you to upload.
This defaults to 2MB and cannot be changed by singapore. Consult the PHP manual
or you server's administrator for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="iifn">Info in file name</a></h2>

<p>If singapore doesn't find a metadata file in a gallery it will try to 
extract some sensible information from the image file and directory names as 
follows:</p>

<p>Underscores (_) are converted to spaces and the file extension is discarded 
by removing all characters after the last . (dot) in the filename. If a filename or 
directory name contains the sequence '<code>_-_</code>' (underscore hyphen underscore) 
or '<code> - </code>' (space hyphen space) then the name will be split on this
separator. The first half will be interpreted as the artist name and the second 
half will be interpreted as the gallery or image name depending on context. If
a separator is not found then the file or directory name is interpreted as the
image or gallery name, respectively.</p>

<p>For example <code>Holiday_Snaps/Bob_Fenderson_-_Pretty_picture_of_Sunset.jpg</code>
will be translated into an image called "Pretty picture of Sunset" by "Bob 
Fenderson" in a gallery called "Holiday Snaps".</p>


<h2><a name="permissions">Help with file permissions</a></h2>

<p>How to make a file writable is dependent on your operating system and 
web server setup and can seem quite daunting for a beginner. One option that 
will work on nearly all Unix/Linux servers is to chmod the relevant 
files/directories to 777 (consult your FTP software documentation for help on 
using the chmod command). However this option is not considered very secure as 
anyone who has write access the web server (such as the owners of other web 
sites hosted on the same computer) can potentially write to or delete these 
directories. There may be a better way to make your files writable by your 
server but this is something you must take up with your server administrator.</p>

<p>One thing you can do to moderately increase security is: once you have changed 
your singapore admin password, chmod the adminusers.csv file back to 755.</p>


<h2><a name="override">Overriding settings</a></h2>

<p>All configuration options may be overridden on a per-gallery and/or 
per-template basis. This means that a particular gallery may use, for example, 
a different template or language to the rest of the site. Also, templates may 
introduce their own configuration settings if they so wish.</p>

<p>Gallery config options are stored in files named <code>gallery.ini</code> in 
the chosen gallery directory. Settings are not inherited by subgalleries; they 
affect only the current gallery and its images.</p>

<p>Template config options are stored in files named <code>template.ini</code> 
in the chosen template directory. Some of these settings are not present in the 
default config file; they are only found in the template config file.</p>

<p>Settings are loaded in this order: default settings (<code>singapore.ini</code>)
&gt; gallery settings (<code>gallery.ini</code>) &gt; template settings 
(<code>template.ini</code>). This may be changed in the future to allow gallery 
settings to override template settings.</p>

<p>Note that there is no restriction on which options may be overridden. 
Overriding some settings may lead to unpredictable operation (e.g. changing 
<code>pathto_galleries</code> in <code>gallery.ini</code>).</p>


<h2><a name="hiding">Hiding galleries</a></h2>

<p>Any gallery (except the root gallery) may be hidden from the listing view
by prefixing the directory name with a dot (<code>.</code>). However it is still
accessible by using its exact URL. For example consider the following directory
structure:</p>

<pre>
galleries/
 |- my_pretty_pictures/
 |  |- trees/
 |  `- flowers/
 |- .a_hidden_gallery/
 |  |- some_embarrassing_pictures/
 |  `- .this_is_also_hidden/
 `- some_other_things/
</pre>

<p>A user browsing the root gallery (e.g. <code>www.example.com/?gallery=.</code>)
will see <code>my_pretty_pictures</code> and <code>some_other_things</code>; 
<code>.a_hidden_gallery</code> and all its contents will be hidden from view. If,
however, the user is supplied with the exact URL (e.g. <code>www.example.com/?gallery=./.a_hidden_gallery</code>)
they will be able to see the contents as usual (in this case only 
<code>some_embarrassing_pictures</code> because <code>.this_is_also_hidden</code>
is hidden as above).</p>

<p>Since a user could guess the exact URL or discover it by some other means, 
this feature is not to be used for concealing sensitive information.</p>
