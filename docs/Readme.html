<h2><a name="release">Release notes</a></h2>

<p>Hmmm, shouldn't be releasing this now because I'm half way through reorganising 
the directory structure but there are many bug fixes in this version that 
I can't be bothered to reintegrate into the old version so here it is.<br />
NOTE ON UPGRADING: Unless you are having trouble with 0.9.3 or you desperately 
want some of the new features in 0.9.4 I would not recommend upgrading to this 
version. Wait until the next version when the re-structuring will (hopefully) 
be completed. First time users should use this version as it will be easier to 
upgrade from.</p>


<h2><a name="install">Installation</a></h2>

<p><strong>singapore</strong> should work 'out of the box' but there are many 
things that can be done to customize it to your needs. Here are some:</p>

<p>Things you MUST do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extract all the files in the archive, conserving the directory hierarchy, 
  to a directory accessible by your web server.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things you SHOULD do:</p>
<ul class="things">
  <li>Run <code>test.php</code> to see if your server is capable of running 
  <strong>singapore</strong>.</li>
  
  <li>Set file permissions. The directories that need to be made writable are:
  <ul>
    <li><code>data/</code> and all subdirectories and files</li>
    <li><code>galleries/</code> and all subdirectories and files</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="#permissions">Help with file permissions</a>.
  </li>

  <li>Run <code>setup.php</code> to create the necessary directories.</li>
  
  <li>Add some galleries and images into the <code>galleries/</code> directory 
  <a href="#managing">More info</a>.</li>

  <li>Log into the admin section and change the password. The username is 
  <code>admin</code> and the default password is <code>password</code>.<br />
  <span class="note">NOTE: a future release will allow multiple admin users with 
  different passwords.</span></li>
  
  <li>Have a browse through <code>data/singapore.ini</code> and look at the 
  available options. Each option has comments explaining its function. For most 
  purposes the default values will be fine but you may be able to tweak them 
  slightly to your benefit.</li>
  
  <li>If your PHP installation uses GD version 2 or later or you have access to 
  <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a> then you can get much 
  nicer generated thumbnails by changing the option in <code>data/singapore.ini</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things you MIGHT do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Edit <code>includes/header.php</code> and <code>includes/footer.php</code>
  or use your own custom header and/or footer files by editing the paths in 
  <code>data/singapore.ini</code>.</li>

  <li>Change the <em>secret string</em> value in <code>includes/class_configuration.php</code>.
  This is not essential but it makes it harder for someone to fake an admin 
  session thereby gaining unauthorised access to your galleries.</li>
  
  <li>Make custom "themes" using CSS. <a href="Development.html#themeing">More info</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="managing">Managing your galleries</a></h2>

<p>If using the <a href="#iifn">info in file name</a> system then all management can be done 
directly on the files using, for example, an ftp client. To create new galleries
simply create a new subdirectory of <code>galleries/</code>. To add, move or delete 
images in a gallery simply add, move or delete the image files in the 
appropriate directory.</p>

<p>If you use the admin mode to edit your galleries or images it will 
automatically create the relevant metadata files. If these files are deleted  
<strong>singapore</strong> will revert to using <em>info in file name</em>.</p>
 
<p>There is currently no support for bulk image upload via the admin interface. You
are recommended to use FTP to upload your images and then use the admin mode to
add image information and for occasional additions and deletions.</p>


<h2><a name="iifn">Info in file name</a></h2>

<p>If <strong>singapore</strong> doesn't find a metadata file in a gallery it will try to 
extract some sensible information from the image file and directory names as 
follows:</p>

<p>Underscores (_) are converted to spaces and the file extension is discarded 
by removing all characters after the last . (dot) in the filename. If a filename or 
directory name contains the sequence '<code>_-_</code>' (underscore hyphen underscore) 
or '<code> - </code>' (space hyphen space) then the name will be split on this
separator. The first half will be interpreted as the artist name and the second 
half will be interpreted as the gallery or image name depending on context. If
a separator is not found then the file or directory name is interpreted as the
image or gallery name, respectively.</p>

<p>For example <code>Holiday_Snaps/Tamlyn_Rhodes_-_Pretty_picture_of_Sunset.jpg</code>
will be translated into an image called "Pretty picture of Sunset" by "Tamlyn 
Rhodes" in a gallery called "Holiday Snaps".</p>


<h2><a name="permissions">Help with file permissions</a></h2>

<p>How to make a file writable is dependent on your operating system and 
web server setup and can seem quite daunting for a beginner. One option that 
will work on nearly all Unix/Linux servers is to chmod the relevant 
files/directories to 777 (consult your FTP software documentation for help on 
using the chmod command). However this option is not considered very secure as 
anyone who has write access the web server (such as the owners of other web 
sites hosted on the same computer) can potentially write to or delete these 
directories. There may be a better way to make your files writable by your 
server but this is something you must take up with your server administrator.</p>

<p>One thing you can do to moderately increase security is: once you have changed 
your singapore admin password, chmod the adminusers.csv file back to 755.</p>
