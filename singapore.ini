;
; Split into sections (Basic, Paths, Functionality & Advanced)
; for ease of reading. Sections are ignored by the script.
;
; Any of these settings can be overridden in gallery.ini or 
; template.ini files. See the readme for more information.
;
; Template specific settings may be found in the template.ini 
; file located in the template's root directory.


[Basic]
;
; settings that most users will want to look at and possibly change
;

thumbnail_software = "gd2"
     ;the software to use to generate the thumbnails
     ;  gd1 = GD v1.x
     ;  gd2 = GD v2.x
     ;  im  = ImageMagick
     
gallery_name = "singapore"
     ;this is the text that will appear in the title bar of all 
     ;generated pages and also the root node of the crumb line
  
template_name = "default"
     ;the name of the template to use when none is specified
     
language = "en"
     ;the language code for the language that you would like to use.
     ;you must have the appropriate language file in the locale directory.

max_image_size = 0
     ;maximum pixel width & height for full-size images. images larger than this will 
     ;be displayed resized to this size using the currently selected thumbnail software
     ;set to 0 to disable image resizing
     
gallery_sort_order = "x"
     ;the order in which galleries will be displayed. Can take the following values:
     ; p = sort by directory name (ascending, default)
     ; P = sort by directory name (descending)
     ; n = sort by gallery name (ascending)
     ; N = sort by gallery name (descending)
     ; i = sort by gallery name (case insensitive, ascending)
     ; I = sort by gallery name (case insensitive, descending)
     ; x = do not sort (default)
     
image_sort_order = "x"
     ;the order in which images will be displayed. Can take the following values:
     ; f = sort by file name (ascending)
     ; F = sort by file name (descending)
     ; n = sort by image name (ascending)
     ; N = sort by image name (descending)
     ; i = sort by image name (case insensitive, ascending)
     ; I = sort by image name (case insensitive, descending)
     ; a = sort by artist name (ascending)
     ; A = sort by artist name (descending)
     ; d = sort by date (ascending)
     ; D = sort by date (descending)
     ;   note: date comparison is done as a string comparison on the 'date' database 
     ;   field. So for example "2003-10-22" comes before "22 October 2003"
     ; l = sort by location (ascending)
     ; L = sort by location (descending)
     ; x = do not sort (default)
     
upload_overwrite = 0
     ;what to do when uploading an image or gallery that already exists:
     ; 0   do not overwrite, raise an error (default)
     ; 1   overwrite without prompting
     ; 2   attempt to generate a new unique name
